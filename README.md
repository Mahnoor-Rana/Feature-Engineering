# <strong>Feature Engineering</strong>

Feature engineering is a machine learning technique that leverages data to create new variables that aren't in the training set. It can produce new features for both supervised and unsupervised learning, with the goal of simplifying and speeding up data transformations while also enhancing model accuracy.


- It is very important step to train the model .
- We have to select those features that is useful and gives best accuracy.

You can see my notebook. All  the work is explained in detail.
